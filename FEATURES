=====================
Tagging from Filename
=====================

I added this feature to id3ren, because i never found a good utility
to set tags to my untagged mp3s. Nearly all useful informations were
already available in the filenames, and i didn't want to do the job twice.

The tagtemplate can contain the following identifiers :
 %a - Artist       %c - Comment  %g - Genre  %s - Song Name
 %t - Album title  %y - Year     %d - Dummy
 
Example :

My mp3s are stored in a directory for each album. Each song is prefixed
by the track number.

bash-2.01$ find "/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater"
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/01 here.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/02 touched.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/03 dirty hole.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/04 pretty when you cry.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/05 i'm dying.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/06 flames.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/07 temptation.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/08 three doors.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/09 the niles edge.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/10 somewhere else to be.mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/11 .mp3
/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/12 you.mp3

I want to tag all thoses mp3s :

id3ren -tagonly -tag -tagfromfilename -tagtemplate="/mp3/%a - %t/%n %s.mp3" \
-genre Alernative -nocomment -year 1998 \
"/mp3/vast - visual audio sensory theater/*.mp3"

If your mp3s are stored in a directory for the artist and a subdirectory for
the album name you could use the following tagtemplate : "%a/%t/%n %s.mp3".
As long as you have a fixed separators between fields, you should be ok.


===================================
Creating Directories while renaming
===================================

id3ren can now automatically create directory entries if the template contains 
"/". You could use a template like "%a/%t/%n %s.mp3" to create a tree for 
your mp3s, the first level would be the artist, the second the album title, 
and then each file would be composed of the track and the song name.
It is useful to set a default field to handle blank fields (for example
-default="unknown").


================
id3 v1.1 Support
================

id3ren, from version 1.1 and up supports id3 v1.1 transparently.
An id3 v1.1 tag will be created only if a track number is present.


==============================
Copying tags from another file
==============================

id3ren can import tags from another tagged file. Use the -copytagfrom
option along with one or several -copy... (tag field) options.
Several source files can be used in sequence, like in this example :
-copytagfrom=/my/first.mp3 -copysong -copyartist \
-copytagfrom=/my/second.mp3 -copyalbum -copycomment
