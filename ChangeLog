1.1b0 2001-07-14 Christophe Bothamy <cbothamy@free.fr>
================
- Added support for id3 v1.1
- Added automatic directory creation when renaming. 
- Added a "-default" option to handle blank fields when renaming.
- Added the possibility to copy tags from other files.
- Changed the default "space" char to a more sensible " " when renaming.
- Uniformisation of the syntaxes of the different options.
  (all options can use = or next arg, with or without quotes)
- Different handling of the options in the resource file (same as commandline).
  Existing .id3renrc files might need an update.

1.0b2 2000-02-01 Christophe Bothamy <cbothamy@free.fr> 
================
- Correction of a display bug in the help screen

1.0b1 2000-12-15 Christophe Bothamy <cbothamy@free.fr>
================
- Reorganisation of directories and files
- Sources tar ball does not contain executable any more.
  I will set up a debian package.
- Due to lack of compiler, Windows support is discontinued. 
  If i get enough feed back, i'll consider install Visual C++ somewhere
  In the meantime, use id3ren 0.97a which contains win32 executable.
  The sources compiles fine under cygwin, maybe you could give it a try
- Tagging a file can be done with informations from the file name. 
  Added -tagfromfilename and -tagffn (synonymns) and -tagtemplate. 
  It's a good idea to use it with the -tagonly option.

0.97a Robert Alto <badcrc@tscnet.com>
=====
- Fixed a short->int screw up on my part that was causing weird things to
  happen...Solaris got a bus error, 95 and Linux didn't read certain options
  correctly.
- Changed usage screen for Linux to "for *nix" cause ascii doesn't like
  things for Linux on his Solaris box.

0.97 Robert Alto <badcrc@tscnet.com>
====
- Added -edit option.
- Several options are now toggles.  For example if you specify -verbose
  in a config file, then you want to disable verbose mode one time, you
  can specify -verbose on the command line and it will disable it for that
  one use.  Options that aren't toggles: -quick, -showtag, -defcase, -upper,
  -lower....and any other option that accepts a second argument, or displays
  info (i.e., -showgen, -help, -template, -space, etc).
- Included some sample rc files in the samples directory.

0.96 Robert Alto <badcrc@tscnet.com>
====
- Included source in archive, with a Makefile for both Linux and Win32.
- Added -nocfg, -nogenre, -remchar, -repchar, -verbose options.
- Added support for config files.  See id3ren.txt for info.
- You can now change specific parts of a tag if a file already has a tag.
  For example, if you have a file that has a tag and only want to change
  the album name, you can use -tag in conjunction with -album.  You will
  still be prompted for other tag info if they are blank unless you use
  the -noalbum
