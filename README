============
Introduction
============
id3ren is used to rename batches of mp3 files by reading the ID3 tag
at the end of the file which contains the song name, artist, album, year,
and a comment.  

The secondary function of id3ren is a tagger, which can create, modify, 
or remove ID3 tags. The id3 fields can be set on the command line, 
entered interactively, or "guessed" from the path and the filename.

Notes
=====
- id3ren is developed and tested on linux, but it should work as is
  on any unix system.

- Windows support is discontinued. It may still work, but it has not been tested
  id3ren is known to compile fine with cygwin.

- Config files should only contain the exact same options as specified on
  the command line.  You can use # at the beginning of a line for a comment.
  Spaces at the beginning of a line are ignored.  NOTE: There is no more
  syntax difference between a config file option and a command line option.

- id3ren first reads all command line options.  If it doesn't find the
  "-nocfg" command line option, it looks for config files in this order:
  1) Reads environment variable ID3REN which should contain the complete
     path to a config file.  If variable doesn't exist or file not found
     then...
  2) Reads environment variable HOME and look for $HOME/.id3renrc.
     If variable doesn't exist or file not found then...
  3) It looks for /etc/id3renrc.
